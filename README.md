A cohort is a customer segment defined by:
•	Time
•	Size
•	Behavior
One of the most popular type of cohort analysis is using the time segment. It seeks to answer questions such as when did we acquire customers, what are the actions that were taken, did we retain them, was there churn?
To understand cohort, we often create a pivot table and this project entails using python to achieve this objective.
